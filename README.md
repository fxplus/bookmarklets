#Helpful FX Plus Bookmarklets

If you are a staff or student on campus in Falmouth Cornwall (FU/UoE) its quite useful to be able to jump from a book or film recommendation to the FX Plus Library catalogue to check if we've got it before looking elsewhere.

Github (quite sensibly) won't allow me to include javascript links here, so to use just download the html menu.

If you have git installed:

    git clone git@github.com:fxplus/bookmarklets.git

Sites supported so far:

* imdb
* goodreads
* rottentomatoes
* suggestmemovie
* wikipedia.org
* flixster.com

*The unminified, commented source of each bookmarklet is also here in case you would like to make a variation*
